## About this project
Soda is a [Drupal distribution](https://www.drupal.org/project/project_distribution).

Drupal Distributions provide site features and functions for a specific type of site as a single download containing Drupal core, contributed modules, themes, and pre-defined configuration. They make it possible to quickly set up a complex, use-specific site in fewer steps than if installing and configuring elements individually.

This project is aimed to collect, manage and distribute (small scale) open data.

## Purpose and potentional users

SODA could be used by any organization, group of people, company etc that would like to collect, manage and distribute open data.

We are mainly focusing to give (public sector) organizations a simple tool to create and share Open Data. 

There is no location or other type of restriction. The tool will be generic and extensible.

Furthermore, it could be used as a restful server to exchange data between devices.

## History

This project started on a 2 day Hackathon (http://hackathess.eu) on 2014 at Thessaloniki, Greece. 
It won the first place among 15 other projects.
Since then we decided to make it a full Drupal distribution and continue it furthermore so we get a complete Drupal solution for small open data.
